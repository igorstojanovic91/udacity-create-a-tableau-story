# Udacity Data Analyst Term 2 Project 4: Create a Tableau Story

For this project, I created a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. The aim of the project was to practice data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

# Data Set 
Loan Data from Prosper: This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
